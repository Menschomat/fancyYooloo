This is a school-project. Most of the code has been distributed by our teacher.

Our task was...
* ...to prevent cheating.
* ...to use Java.logging.
* ...to build a very basic bot.
* ...to implement some JUnitTests.

### The quality of the given Codebase was not very good, so do not juge and take a look on my other projects.
